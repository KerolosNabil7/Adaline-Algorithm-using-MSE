# Adaline-Algorithm-using-MSE-
Adaline (Adaptive Linear Neuron) is a single-layer neural network that uses a linear activation function to make predictions. It adjusts the weights of input features to minimize the difference between predicted and actual output using the gradient descent optimization algorithm and mean squared error cost function.
